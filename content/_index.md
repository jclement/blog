Hello, my name is Jeff Clement.  I'm a Product Manager/Developer based in Calgary, AB, Canada.

I love writing code and building software in various languages.  I'm ~~obsessed with~~ fascinated by privacy and security tech.  Lately, I've been having fun moving more of my online life into self-hosted services.  When time permits, I love to get out into the mountains where I enjoy hiking, camping, and riding unicycles.  

This website is a collection of stuff on all of the above :)
